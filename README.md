# ILoveNougat

Android app built for the 2017 Zappos Internship Challenge

How it works?

    Accepts a search query from the user
    Search query is passed to the Zappos API to fetch relevant product entries
    Parses the results of the search and displays them in a RecyclerView
    On clicking a product, it does a comparison for the product's price on 6PM.com
    Notifies the user if the product is cheaper on 6PM.com and provides him with a purchase link.
    Share the product with a friend who has the application installed
